Quick, versatile, and powerful, the Man-o- War looks much like a massive plant-like moth or butterfly flying through space. With its powerful wings, it can quickly move itself into a better position for attacks. This has made the Man-o-War one of the more maneuverable ships in space and a terror for the enemies of the Elven Imperial Navy.</p><h2>Example Weapons</h2> <ul><li>5x <em>12-Pounder Long Gun</em>, 2x front, 2x starboard, 2x port, 2x rear</li></ul><h1>Model Variations</h1> <p>The Man-o-War comes in a handful of varieties, but like the Cutter, the most commonly available ones are not grown in the Elven Imperial Navy shipyards but built out of wood.</p><h2>Starfly Hull</h2> <p>The starfly variant is the original grown by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is exceptionally difficult to find if one isn't given one by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant gains the following feature:</p><p><strong>Starfly Hull.</strong> This ship counts as a mega creature when targeted by healing spells cast through an arcane cannon.</p><h2>Thick Wood Hull</h2> <p>This is the wooden variant crafted by shipwrights not associated with the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is more commonly found, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (90째)</p><h2>Fighter Carrier</h2> <p>This variation was originally designed by the Elven Imperial Navy, but other shipwrights have also begun to mimic its design. When grown by elves, this variation is the same as the starfly, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45째) and it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints. In exchange, its cargo hold is increased to 50 tons. When created by other shipwrights, this variation is the same as the thick wood hull, except its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45째), it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints, and its AC is reduced to 15.</p><p>In exchange for these reductions, the cargo hold on both types is increased to 50 tons. This allows the Man-o-War to carry up to 10 fighter bays for deploying fighter craft, whether they be Battle Flitters or Blades. The Elven Imperial Navy almost exclusively use this variation for carrying large numbers of elven Bladesingers prepared to use their swordsmanship skills in a Battle Flitter.</p><h2>Mobile Saloon</h2> <p>This variation is usually created by independent elves or dwarves that are looking to make it into a saloon. This variation usually starts as the thick wood hull, and then has its speed reduced to 2,500ft (45째) and its AC reduced to 15 in exchange for its cargo hold increasing to 42 tons.  This storage space is used for stockpiling anything that travelers might pay a premium for. Most of the time, this is alcohol or drugs. After months of travel, most sailors are more than willing to pay the considerably higher prices of the mobile saloon owners. Mobile saloons also tend to carry food, water, star charts, and just about any standard commodity a wildjammer in space might need, so long as they are willing to pay more than market value for it.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg.

This variant loses its ability to land anywhere but a space dock and has its cargo hold reduced to 3 tons, but in exchange it gains 2 additional large hardpoints.

This variation's speed is increased to 2,000ft (45째) and the four tentacle mounted hardpoints are changed to small size and affixed with four <em>fire projectors</em>.</p><h2>Mobile Base</h2> <p>This variation was designed to be a forward base for explorers or colonies from already established settlements. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to tentacles are removed and replaced with 4 more tons of cargo storage and 2 new space docks for ships to dock at between exploratory missions.

This new type of flitter was designed to fully enclose a single Fighter Helmsman and allow their senses to extend outward across the entire vessel, in the same way a standard Wildjammer Helm allows a Helmsman to merge with their wildjammer.

In place of it, the Battle Flitter carries a mechanical Helm that generates propulsion through residual magic found in wildspace.

Originally designed by various human nations in space, it was created to be one of the cheapest combat oriented wildjammers on the market. Most other cheap combat wildjammers tend to be fitted for combat after the fact, like a fighterfly variant of the Dragonfly. The goal of the Threshership was to create an affordable wildjammer designed around combat, rather than being retroactively fitted for combat.</p><p>The Threshership has three hardpoints, two aimed out of its eyeslots and one sitting on the top deck just above the head. The head itself acts as a ram, intending to charge up to enemy wildjammers or mega creatures and hit them in close range. This has lead to many using the Threshershark as a Fire Projector platform, moving in close, hitting hard, and lighting targets on fire.</p><p>What adds to the versatility of the Threshership beyond just a combat wildjammer is that the wildjammer's fins act as landing gear for ground landings. This is beneficial since the cargo storage doors on the side of the wildjammer are partially submerged when in water, making unloading a real chore and the risk of taking on water not negligible.</p><h2>Example Weapons</h2> <ul><li><em>Carronade</em>, 1x front</li><li>2x <em>Medium Ballista</em></li></ul><h1>Model Variations</h1> <p>While Thresherships do carry the artistic styling of whatever shipwright worked on creating it, there are no major variations to speak of.

Others might want to enhance the small hardpoint located just above the head and ram by reducing cargo storage space.
