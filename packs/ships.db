The main variation of the Cuttle Command is to act as a command ship through the use of its Helm Network. This allows the Helmsman of the Cuttle Command to watch the movements of all linked wildjammers and coordinate a strategic plan between all of them in real time. This makes the Cuttle Command a powerful ship in managing fleet tactics.</p><h3>Wizard's Ship</h3> <p>Much like the Dragonfly variation of the same name, this variation sees the Cuttle Command transformed from command ship into a mobile laboratory, workshop, or shrine.  With considerably more room than the Dragonfly (and considerably higher cost), this option is really only there for those with large sums of wealth and a desire for privacy. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to a tentacle are removed in exchange for increasing its cargo storage to 62 tons.</p><h3>Fiery Victory</h3> <p>This variation is named after the famed wildjammer, the <i>Ultimate Victory</i> that was regrettably destroyed in a mutiny.  This variation's speed is increased to 2,000ft (45°) and the four tentacle mounted hardpoints are changed to small size and affixed with four @Compendium[wjmais.items.Fire Projector]{fire projectors}.</p><h3>Mobile Base</h3> <p>This variation was designed to be a forward base for explorers or colonies from already established settlements. The 3 large hardpoints not mounted to tentacles are removed and replaced with 4 more tons of cargo storage and 2 new space docks for ships to dock at between exploratory missions. This variant is usually designed to carry a large number of supplies, as well as making space for a tavern or other recreational activities for sailors.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 66"},"traits":{"size":"grg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"water","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"token":{"name":"Cuttle Command","img":"modules/wjmais/assets/cuttle-command-token.webp","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"elevation":0,"actorData":{},"effects":[]},"items":[{"_id":"t0nDM9LzkFUuG18z","name":"Arcane Reinforcement","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The Helmsman of this ship has advantage on all saving throws against mega spells made for the ship.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"WJMAiS","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"wjjtQILzxP55BGxr","name":"Blink (1/Day)","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This ship can use all of its movement to teleport to any unoccupied space within 6,000 feet, facing any direction.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"WJMAiS","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"JUiAFSk1MBNHYyL7","name":"Helm Network","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>By spending one hour in close proximity with a willing wildjammer, the Cuttle Command can form a telepathic link to it.

The remaining 24 are split half down each side of the main deck for broadside attacks. Regrettably, much like the Galleon, the Clipper wasn't originally designed for use in space. As a result, both ships lack the elegance in design necessary for smooth sailing in space, reflected by low maneuverability.</p><p>That said, you can't put 26 cannons on a ship without the giff being interested There are plenty of wildjammers out there, but the Clipper has a lot more gunpowder than others of its class.

When used as a heavy warship, the giff commodores will often use these ships in pairs as a way to increasing firepower and limiting the ability of an enemy to outmaneuver both of them. Alternatively, the Clipper can be used as a command ship for a giff admiral Usually when this is done, it is accompanied by 3 to 6 additional clippers as supporting heavy warships.</p><p>There is only one configuration that greatly deviates and it is generally created by groundlings, called the Merchantman.  Those who are native to wildspace will generally avoid using the Clipper at all and favor other cargo ships and the giff are highly unlikely to change the Clipper away from cannons.</p><h3>Merchantman</h3> <p>Groundling civilizations don't only build Clippers as warships, but sometimes as cargo transport or mercantile ships. This variation removes the forward and aft medium hardpoint and every other hardpoint along the main deck is slimmed to a medium hardpoint. In exchange for this, the cargo storage of the Clipper is increased to 40 tons without impacting its defensive abilities to too great a degree.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 64"},"traits":{"size":"huge","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"water","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"token":{"name":"Clipper","img":"modules/wjmais/assets/clipper-token.webp","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":3,"height":3,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"elevation":0,"actorData":{},"effects":[]},"items":[{"_id":"nEbwWScea2SPtDyr","name":"Aggression","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When this ship has 100 hull points or fewer remaining, it has advantage on its attack rolls.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"WJMAiS","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"rBgX8btU9KyyT6T5","name":"Resilient Design","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This ship has resistance to damage it takes from attacks that hit it in the front.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"WJMAiS","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"V83f36uqMVVRk46y","name":"Reckless Bombard (1/Turn)","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The captain of this wildjammer can use their action to declare a bombardment, granting the ship's gunners advantage on attack rolls until the beginning of the captain's next turn.

Quick, versatile, and powerful, the Man-o- War looks much like a massive plant-like moth or butterfly flying through space. With its powerful wings, it can quickly move itself into a better position for attacks. This has made the Man-o-War one of the more maneuverable ships in space and a terror for the enemies of the Elven Imperial Navy.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>5x @Compendium[wjmais.items.12-Pounder Long Gun], 2x front, 2x starboard, 2x port, 2x rear</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The Man-o-War comes in a handful of varieties, but like the Cutter, the most commonly available ones are not grown in the Elven Imperial Navy shipyards but built out of wood.</p><h3>Starfly Hull</h3> <p>The starfly variant is the original grown by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is exceptionally difficult to find if one isn't given one by the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant gains the following feature:</p><p><strong>Starfly Hull.</strong> This ship can be healed by the @Compendium[wjmais.spells.Repair Hull] spell multiple times per day.</p><h3>Thick Wood Hull</h3> <p>This is the wooden variant crafted by shipwrights not associated with the Elven Imperial Navy. This variant is more commonly found, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (90°)</p><h3>Fighter Carrier</h3> <p>This variation was originally designed by the Elven Imperial Navy, but other shipwrights have also begun to mimic its design. When grown by elves, this variation is the same as the starfly, but its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45°) and it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints. In exchange, its cargo hold is increased to 50 tons. When created by other shipwrights, this variation is the same as the thick wood hull, except its speed is reduced to 2,500ft (45°), it loses 3 of its medium hardpoints, and its AC is reduced to 15.</p><p>In exchange for these reductions, the cargo hold on both types is increased to 50 tons. This allows the Man-o-War to carry up to 10 fighter bays for deploying fighter craft, whether they be Spirit Warriors or Blades. The Elven Imperial Navy almost exclusively use this variation for carrying large numbers of elven Bladesingers prepared to use their swordsmanship skills in a Spirit Warrior.</p><h3>Mobile Saloon</h3> <p>This variation is usually created by independent elves or dwarves that are looking to make it into a saloon. This variation usually starts as the thick wood hull, and then has its speed reduced to 2,500ft (45°) and its AC reduced to 15 in exchange for its cargo hold increasing to 42 tons.  This storage space is used for stockpiling anything that travelers might pay a premium for. Most of the time, this is alcohol or drugs. After months of travel, most sailors are more than willing to pay the considerably higher prices of the mobile saloon owners. Mobile saloons also tend to carry food, water, star charts, and just about any standard commodity a wildjammer in space might need, so long as they are willing to pay more than market value for

These enormous undead insects would house an elven warrior inside of their chest cavity and amplify the skill of the warrior. This allowed for elven warriors to bring their considerable skill with a sword into ship vs ship combat.</p><p>Acquiring a spirit warrior wasn't easy. A promising warrior would be granted a small egg, no larger than the size of a pinhead, that had undergone a secret ritual. The warrior would incubate the egg, protecting it and warming it with their own body. After half a year, the egg would hatch into a larva. The warrior would raise the larva and form a strong emotional bond. They would feed it, play with it, think happy thoughts that the larva can feel. This lasts until the larva is a year old, at which point it has matured. Once the larva has matured, it continues to live with the warrior until it dies of old age.</p><p>As soon as it dies, the magic cast upon it as an egg activates. The carcass expands to an enormous size and its chest cavity grows a space for its bonded warrior. When its bonded warrior enters the chest cavity for the first time, the two of them become as one. The warrior's skill becomes the spirit warrior's skill, and the spirit warrior's body becomes the warrior's body.</p><p>True spirit warriors are hard to find and impossible to buy. If a spirit warrior's bonded warrior is dead or abandoned it, another creature can occupy it and try to bond, but that is rare. The easiest way to get a hold of a Spun warrior is to buy an arcanomechanical one off the market. These don't bonding with the warrior in the same way as a true spirit warrior, but they do just fine as a fighter-craft.</p><h3>Helm</h3> <p>The spirit warrior doesn't carry a Wildjammer Helm. Instead, it either flies naturally or mechanically. This generates propulsion through residual magic in wildspace. It can't fly at jamming speeds and the Fighter Helmsman doesn't need to be a spellcaster.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li><em>Longsword (Mega Scale)</em></li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The spirit warrior comes in a variety of types The stat block presented here is a baseline stat block.

This design is easily adaptable by shipwrights, allowing them to add additional equipment. This variant gains the following:</p><p><strong>Thick Wood Hull.</strong> This spirit warrior can equip with a shield.</p><h3>Ironclad</h3> <p>This arcanomechanical variant of the spirit warrior is built with metal plating, making it both durable and sluggish.

This variant loses its ability to land anywhere but a space dock and has its cargo hold reduced to 3 tons, but in exchange it gains 2 additional large hardpoints. These additional hardpoints are almost always equipped with heavy ballistae because of the small crew size of the Wasp.  While 8 crew are required to make it function, that leaves just 10 crew for 3 large hardpoints.</p><h3>Bumble Bee</h3> <p>The bumble bee variant of the Wasp loses its large hardpoint and can only dock at space docks in exchange for 6 additional tons of cargo storage. This variant looks far more bloated than the standard Wasp, marking it as a merchant ship. Often bee class Wasps will find a way to disguse themselves as bumble bee variants to lure in unsuspecting pirates.</p><h3>Quickling</h3> <p>The quickling variant of the Wasp has its hull stripped in favor of quick maneuverability.

The goal in creating the Threshership was to build an affordable and formidable combat ship for new privateers, who so often found themselves retrofitting commercial ships for combat purposes.</p><p>The Threshership has three hardpoints, two aimed out of its eye slots and one sitting on the top deck just above the head. The head itself acts as a ram, intending to charge up to enemy wildjammers or mega creatures and hit them in close range. This has lead to many using the Threshership as a Fire Projector platform, moving in close, hitting hard, and covering ships in waves of fire.</p><p>What adds to the versatility of the Threshership beyond just a combat wildjammer is that the wildjammer's fins act as landing gear for ground landings.

This variant loses its ability to land anywhere but a space dock and has its cargo hold reduced to 3 tons, but in exchange it gains 2 additional large hardpoints. These additional hardpoints are almost always equipped with heavy ballistae because of the small crew size of the Wasp.  While 8 crew are required to make it function, that leaves just 10 crew for 3 large hardpoints.</p><h3>Bumble Bee</h3> <p>The bumble bee variant of the Wasp loses its large hardpoint and can only dock at space docks in exchange for 6 additional tons of cargo storage.

These enormous undead insects would house an elven warrior inside of their chest cavity and amplify the skill of the warrior. This allowed for elven warriors to bring their considerable skill with a sword into ship vs ship combat.</p><p>Acquiring a spirit warrior wasn't easy. A promising warrior would be granted a small egg, no larger than the size of a pinhead, that had undergone a secret ritual. The warrior would incubate the egg, protecting it and warming it with their own body. After half a year, the egg would hatch into a larva. The warrior would raise the larva and form a strong emotional bond. They would feed it, play with it, think happy thoughts that the larva can feel. This lasts until the larva is a year old, at which point it has matured. Once the larva has matured, it continues to live with the warrior until it dies of old age.</p><p>As soon as it dies, the magic cast upon it as an egg activates. The carcass expands to an enormous size and its chest cavity grows a space for its bonded warrior. When its bonded warrior enters the chest cavity for the first time, the two of them become as one. The warrior's skill becomes the spirit warrior's skill, and the spirit warrior's body becomes the warrior's body.</p><p>True spirit warriors are hard to find and impossible to buy. If a spirit warrior's bonded warrior is dead or abandoned it, another creature can occupy it and try to bond, but that is rare. The easiest way to get a hold of a Spun warrior is to buy an arcanomechanical one off the market. These don't bonding with the warrior in the same way as a true spirit warrior, but they do just fine as a fighter-craft.</p><h3>Helm</h3> <p>The spirit warrior doesn't carry a Wildjammer Helm.

This wildjammer is affixed with a Lifejammer Helm like most neogi ships, allowing them to drain the life of their slaves to propel the ship through space. It carries far fewer weapons and is significantly more vulnerable to attack. In spite of this, the neogi use the Mindspider primarily as a command ship. Just as the small neogi controls many large umber hulks, the smaller Mindspider controls the larger Deathspider.</p><p>Neogi generally don't deal with any species, resulting in both the Mindspider and Deathspider being a rather expensive wildjammer to acquire.</p><h3>Example Weapons</h3> <ul><li>3x @Compendium[wjmais.items.Medium Catapult], 1x front</li><li>@Compendium[wjmais.items.Piercing Appendages], 1x front</li></ul><h2>Model Variations</h2> <p>The Mindspider comes in a wide variety of styles, thanks to the fact that each is designed to suit the neogi that commands it. This means the Mindspider is generally so widely varied it's impossible to say what the average one is.  That said, there is one major variation that stands out.</p><h3>Broodship</h3> <p>This variation is designed for colonization. The Mindspider has its weapons, crew, and Helm all removed. The hull is thickened enough to survive a fall down onto the surface of a planet. The neogi then put an old master inside of the broodship and drop it onto a planet they seek to colonize. The ship will crash onto the surface, the eggs of the old master will hatch, and once the infants finish devouring the old master, they will begin to spread out across the planet.</p><p>So far, every attempt at this type of colonization has failed thanks to the quick intervention of organizations and militaries opposed to the neogi. Most fear that it is only a matter of time before this method becomes more successful.</p>","public":""},"source":"WJMAiS pg. 55"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dimensions":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"vehicleType":"water","cargo":{"crew":[],"passengers":[]}},"token":{"name":"Mindspider","img":"modules/wjmais/assets/mindspider-token.webp","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"Bulwark Points"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"elevation":0,"actorData":{},"effects":[]},"items":[{"_id":"EFNwABVLxJZBUCz0","name":"Biomatter Hull","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/profession-sailing-ship.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If this ship has fewer than 30 hull points at the beginning of each round, it regains 10 hull points.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"WJMAiS","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kKrrDlkpfIaOdPk6":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"0DNoCe5n83okr8gV","name":"Collide Attack","type":"weapon","img":"icons/skills/melee/shield-damaged-broken-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"\n\t\t<p>If your ship is Heavy Frigate-sized (3x3) or smaller, as an action you can move up to your speed within your cone of movement and enter the space of a ship or mega creature.
